    It is a weather forecast bot which can provide a 12-hour forecast, 1-7 day forecast, as well as provide automated daily weather forecasts.
    <br><br> Daily forecasts also come with a fun video depending on the highest temperature for that day. 
    All of the functionality can be configured purely through using chat commands in a Discord channel.`],

    automated moderation tool. Its main goal was to automatically identify and ban scam advertisement messages. <br><br> 
    A fully realized implementation of Yuuka can be found in SFU Anime's own Discord bot, <a href='https://github.com/SFUAnime/Ren'>Ren.</a> 
    Here, Yuuka was implemented as a cog called <a href='https://github.com/SFUAnime/Ren/tree/V3/testing/cogs/gatekeep'>\"Gatekeep\".</a> 
    This cog implementation expanded upon the functionality and customizablity of Yuuka. If your server uses the Red Discord Bot or any fork of it, 
    then you can try my cog out by installing <a href='https://github.com/SFUAnime/lui-cogs-v3'>lui-cogs.</a>`],

    to provide a nice graphical interface to run the algorithm.`]
